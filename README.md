## Committing

Committing will go through `git-cz`. This will give you a list of options.
Here you can select what kind of change it is, and add a nicely formatted commit message.

Make sure your commit message is informative, and encapsulates everything that you've changed/added.
If you don't have enough space, it will ask you for a longer explanation later in the process. Make sure to fill this out.
